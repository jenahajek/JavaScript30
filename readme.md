# JavaScript30 course

My take on the [JavaScript 30 Day Challenge](https://JavaScript30.com).

I really want to learn JS. I actually want to learn JS very well. To do that, I study the theory and principles, while putting it to practice with this practical series. Hopefully, it will help me to gain deep insight to this powerful language. I'll share my journey, results and advices for you guys, who are in similar situation, wh want to learn in order to build better things.
