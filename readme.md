# JavaScript30 course

My take on the [JavaScript 30 Day Challenge](https://JavaScript30.com).

I really want to learn JS. I actually want to learn JS very well. While theoretical lectures are providing deep insights, I tend to forget them very quickly, unless I put them in practice right away. That's why I decided to compliment them with this practical series.

Thanks to combining there two approaches I will (hopefully) understand programming principles and learn to use them effectively.

I'll share my journey, results and advices for you, who also want to learn in order to build better things.
