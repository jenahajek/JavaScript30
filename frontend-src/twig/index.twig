    <p>My take on the <a href="https://JavaScript30.com">JavaScript 30 Day Challenge</a>.</p>

    <p>I really want to learn JS. I actually want to learn JS very well. While theoretical lectures are providing deep insights, I tend to forget them very quickly, unless I put them in practice right away. That’s why I decided to compliment them with this practical series.</p>

    <p>Thanks to combining these two approaches I will (hopefully) understand programming principles and learn to use them effectively.</p>

    <p>I’ll share my journey, results and advices for you, who also want to learn in order to build better things. So, here we go!</p>
